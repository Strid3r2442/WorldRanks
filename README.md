# WorldRanks

My implementation of the [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io) WorldRanks challenge. Decided it was a bit more interesting way to learn the [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com) Rust framework than the over used Todo app.


### Serving the app
Ensure dioxus-cl has been installed.

Run the following command in the root of the project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve
```
